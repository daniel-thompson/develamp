develamp - the R&D amplifier
============================

develamp is a framework to play with guitar based DSP.

It is a toolbox providing features like "true bypass" (to prevent NaN
propagation out of a broken processor) and built-in plotting.

Most of the processing is based on [faust](http://faust.grame.fr/)
meaning most of develamp's user interface can (and is) auto generated.
Little or no attention is applied to the aesthetics of the interface.

The project is incomplete and always intended to remain so! Thus if
you don't intend to develop or play with your own DSP ideas with it
then [guitarix](http://guitarix.sf.net/) is almost certainly better
suited to your needs.
